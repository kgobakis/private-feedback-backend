# private-feedback-backend

Private feedback is an app that would facilitate constructive dialogue between proprietor and customer. Because feedback is private, proprietors who have just began their businesses do not have to worry about a bad review stunting the growth of their businesses. Customers would also receive benefits for their feedback, such as getting a free cup of coffee, after earning enough points from giving feedback. Our goal is to build the app so that feedback is respectful, with depth, and constructive.
